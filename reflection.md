What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I am confused about how to store instances in a list while keeping track of their matching IDs. I don't know how to get the price or other information of a specific computer stored in the inventory. Overall I wasn't able to fully finish this assignment. I think I have a gap in knowledge about how classes communicate with each other and how to share information among methods, as well as what is the property of an instance. I know that my code is not finished and I missed some important aspects. I believe next time I should start earlier and go to TA hours when I encounter difficulties.
